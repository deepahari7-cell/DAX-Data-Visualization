# DAX-Data-Visualization
E-Commerce Sales Analysis — Power BI Project
📘 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data using Power BI.
You will explore sales trends, profitability, and target achievement by applying Data Modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and interactive visualizations.

🎯 Objective

To transform and analyze sales data from multiple sources, calculate key business metrics, and build insightful dashboards that reveal trends and performance across categories, time, and regions.

📂 Dataset Files

You will work with the following CSV files:

List of Orders.csv — Contains customer and order information (Order ID, Order Date, Customer, City, State, etc.).

Order Details.csv — Includes product-level details such as Category, Sub-Category, Quantity, Amount, and Profit.

Sales Target.csv — Contains monthly and category-wise sales targets.

🧩 1. Data Modeling

Before visualization, data modeling must be completed to ensure relational integrity and accurate calculations.

Steps:

Import all three CSV files into Power BI.

Establish the following relationships:

List of Orders ↔ Order Details — via Order ID

Order Details ↔ Sales Target — via Category

Ensure all relationships are active and in the correct cardinality (typically one-to-many).

Confirm data types for numeric, date, and text fields.

🧮 2. Calculated Columns (Using DAX)
🧱 a) Category Type

Create a new column in the Order Details table that combines Category and Sub-Category:

Category Type = [Category] & " - " & [Sub-Category]

💰 b) Revenue per Order

Compute revenue per order as the product of Amount and Quantity:

Revenue per Order = [Amount] * [Quantity]

📊 c) Sales Category

Categorize each order based on whether its Amount is above or below the average:

Sales Category =
IF([Amount] > AVERAGE('Order Details'[Amount]), "Above Average", "Below Average")


Outcome:
Enhanced data granularity for analyzing performance by category, order, and sales strength.

📏 3. Calculated Measures (Using DAX)
🔢 a) Order Count

Measure the total number of orders:

Order Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('Order Details'[Order ID])

🏙️ b) Average Profit in Delhi

Calculate the average profit for orders placed in Delhi:

Average Profit (Delhi) =
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('Order Details'[Profit]),
    'List of Orders'[City] = "Delhi"
)

📅 c) Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales

Compute the cumulative sales from the start of the year to the current order date:

YTD Sales =
TOTALYTD(
    SUM('Order Details'[Amount]),
    'List of Orders'[Order Date]
)


Outcome:
Key KPIs ready for use in visual dashboards to monitor sales and profitability performance.
